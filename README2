I would use Google Chrome to make sure everything works nicely, but other browsers work too, this is why its not on the other readme.
The "•" symbol only works on chrome (from my tests), when you seaarch up "Tame Impala" the instagram link will display the "•" symbol as "â€¢" for some reason. Chrome (and probably other browsers) show it normally.
